# Comprehensive Market Analysis Model Using Python

## Project Overview
This project develops a comprehensive market analysis program in Python, offering a range of functions to analyze and derive insights from stock data. It caters to investors, investment firms, and hedge funds seeking to make informed investment decisions based on data-driven analysis.

## Key Components and Methodologies

1. **Data Visualization**
   - Line charts for tracking stock price trends over time
   - Candlestick charts for detailed price action analysis
   - Custom feature visualization for exploring various stock data attributes
   - Linear regression plots to identify relationships between data features

2. **Technical Analysis**
   - Moving Average calculations for trend identification
   - Relative Strength Index (RSI) for momentum analysis
   - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) for trend and momentum assessment

3. **Financial Metrics**
   - Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio for stock valuation
   - Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio for assessing market value relative to sales
   - Total Return calculation for overall stock performance evaluation

4. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE) calculation for assessing model fit
   - T-test implementation for comparing means of different data features
